# Foulum weather data
See [this readme.md file](https://github.com/sashahafner/AU-myndighedsbetjening/blob/main/weather/readme.md) for the source of this file.
As explained there, weather data were downloaded from <http://agro-web01t.uni.au.dk/klimadb/> under "Døgnværdier fra 2014" on 1 November 2021.

Unlike the hourly data (W/m2) these radiation values are in MJ/m2, according to the source.
That is why the average over all days is around 10 when 100 W/m2 is expected.
