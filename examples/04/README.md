# STM-applications example 4
Calculation of stored slurry temperature for multiple scenarios with simplified weather and slurry level inputs.
This README file explains how to run the simulations in example 4.
This example differs from 1 and 2 by using separate sub-directories for input and output files.
Also, R scripts are included for creating plots.
Note that if you do not have R installed, or are missing the add-on packages needed, or have not set up your computer to use the `Rscript` command, the plotting scripts will not run.
But you will still get output files from STM.

# Windows
Double-click the batch file `run.bat`.
See the file contents (open in a text editor) to understand what the file does and how to make changes.

# Linux
Run the shell script `run.sh` in a shell with the following command: `./run.sh`.
As with Windows, open the script to see what it does.
