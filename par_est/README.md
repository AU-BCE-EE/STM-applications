# `par_est` directory
Files for automated parameter estimation using measurements from Sweden.

# To use
For the latest version of parameters, copy `final_pars/pars.txt`.
There is no need work with any other files.

# To check
To see how the model performs with the estimated parameter values, look at the plot in `plots`.
Three sites were used for parmeter estimation; Lindö was not.
All locations are in Sweden.

# To run
If interested, anyone is free to use the scripts to repeat or modify the parameter estimation procedure that was used here.
Run `scripts/main.R` in R to run parameter estimation and to plot results.
Scripts are designed for a Linux machine with the sed utility (and have only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4).
