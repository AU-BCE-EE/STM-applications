# Slurry level data

Sources:

* `F_level`: Spreadsheet file `Rennie et al Figure 3 Ta Tm(1).xlsx` shared by email by Andy VanderZaag in late 2022. See "year" column in level file for information on which years were used. First available observation in spreadsheet was used to end of the year, and 2016 (later) level data were used for earlier days of the year.
